     * Signed messages are not necessary to provide message integrity (tamper evidence),

     * with the authenticated encryption in DIDComm encrypted messages. Signed messages are only

     * the recipient is not known in advance (e.g., in a broadcast scenario).
     * We therefore expect signed messages to be used in a few cases, but not as a matter of course.

     * @param `sign_by` a DID or key ID the sender uses for signing
