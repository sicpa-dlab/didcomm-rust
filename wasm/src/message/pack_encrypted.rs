     * Produces `DIDComm Encrypted Message`
     * https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#didcomm-encrypted-message.
     *
     * A DIDComm encrypted message is an encrypted JWM (JSON Web Messages) and
     * hides its content from all but authorized recipients, discloses (optionally) and proves
     * the sender to exactly and only those recipients, and provides integrity guarantees.
     * It is important in privacy-preserving routing. It is what normally moves over network
     * transports in DIDComm applications, and is the safest format for storing DIDComm data at rest.
     *
     * Encryption is done as following:
     *  - Encryption is done via the keys from the `keyAgreement` verification relationship in the DID Doc
     *  - if `to` is a DID, then multiplex encryption is done for all keys from the
     *    receiver's `keyAgreement` verification relationship
     *    which are compatible the sender's key.
     *  - if `to` is a key ID, then encryption is done for the receiver's `keyAgreement`
     *    verification method identified by the given key ID.
     *  - if `from` is a DID, then sender `keyAgreement` will be negotiated based on recipient preference and
     *    sender-recipient crypto compatibility.
     *  - if `from` is a key ID, then the sender's `keyAgreement` verification method
     *    identified by the given key ID is used.
     *  - if `from` is None, then anonymous encryption is done and there will be no sender authentication property.
     *
     * It's possible to add non-repudiation by providing `sign_by` parameter.
     *
     * @param `to` recipient DID or key ID the sender uses encryption.
     * @param `from` a sender DID or key ID. If set message will be repudiable authenticated or anonymous otherwise.
     *    Must match `from` header in Plaintext if the header is set.
     * @param `sign_by` if `Some` message will be additionally signed to provide additional non-repudiable authentication
     *    by provided DID/Key. Signed messages are only necessary when the origin of plaintext must be provable
     *    to third parties, or when the sender can’t be proven to the recipient by authenticated encryption because
     *    the recipient is not known in advance (e.g., in a broadcast scenario).
     *    Adding a signature when one is not needed can degrade rather than enhance security because
     *    it relinquishes the sender’s ability to speak off the record.
     * @param `did_resolver` instance of `DIDResolver` to resolve DIDs.
     * @param `kms` instance of `KeyManagementService` to resolve sender DID keys secrets.
     * @param `options` allow fine configuration of packing process.
     *
     * @returns Tuple `[encrypted_message, metadata]`.
     * - `encrypted_message` A DIDComm encrypted message as a JSON string.
     * - `metadata` additional metadata about this `pack` execution like used keys identifiers,
     *   used messaging service.
