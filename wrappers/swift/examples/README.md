## Example for iOS

This is a short description of how to run the example of DidcommSDK. You can find the source code [here](./DidcommExampleiOS).

Make sure you have pods installed:

Run on [DidcommExampleiOS](./DidcommExampleiOS) folder.

```bash
pod install
```

Then open `DidcommExampleiOS.xcworkspace` created installing pods.

Now you can run DidcommExampleiOS for any iOS device. See Xcode logs to see the SDK working.
